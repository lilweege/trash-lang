# trash-lang

My first programming language written from scratch in C

NOTE: This is very much an unfinished work in progess (as evident by the mess of code in `src`). It only barely works with a few of the examples. Many things are subject to change and improve.

## Quick Start

#### Windows

Any of the following are viable options for building the project:

- Run the `make.bat` script by typing `make` or `.\make.bat` from an msvc-enabled terminal.
- Run GNU `make` from within a WSL terminal.
- Run MinGW `make`.

```console
> make
> .\bin\trash.exe examples\hello.trash
```

#### Posix

I have not tested this on a mac, so please let me know if you try. It should work otherwise on Linux.

- Run GNU `make`.

```console
$ make
$ ./bin/trash examples/hello.trash
```
